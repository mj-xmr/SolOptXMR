# SolOptXMR
Solar Optimal mining of XMR.

![soloptxmr-logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63722585/163665392-cae163e6-a405-4692-8b05-b98480bc0911.svg)


The goal is to create open-source software that aids people mining Monero with excess solar power (as well as other supplementing renewables) in the most profitable way. 
It will accommodate for issues such as:

- Time of day
- Weather fluctuations
- Avoiding depleting batteries below a threshold, that would damage them
- Avoiding overheating of the mining rig
- Leaving enough power for your daily use

# Quickstart
In case these instructions become outdated, please refer to the steps of the [CI](.github/workflows/linux.yml).

## Preparation
Please run the below scripts. They are meant to be non-interactive and will require root permissions (via `sudo`). 
When in doubt, please view their contents with `cat` for an objective assessment of their functionalities.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mj-xmr/SolOptXMR.git # Clone this repo (assuming it's not a fork)
cd SolOptXMR		# Enter the cloned repo's dir
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install Python packages (either use this command or its fitting alternative) 
./util/prep-env.sh	# Prepare the environment - downloads example data and creates useful symlinks
./util/deps-pull.sh	# Download the maintaned dependencies
./util/deps-build.sh	# Build and install the unmanaged dependencies (uses sudo for installation)
./util/config.sh	# Configure your rig
```

## Building & running
```bash
./ci-default          # Build and run the tests
./soloptxmr.py        # Run the prediction with default parameters  
./soloptxmr.py --help # Print all the available options 
```
By default the script performs the predictions 3 days ahead from now, assuming the battery charge at its reasonable minimum, set by the `battery.json`.

In order to alter the default behavior, the main script can be ran with the following example options:
```bash
./soloptxmr.py \
--days-horizon 5 \
--battery-charge-ah 75.2 \
--start-date 2022-02-20T20:22
```
or equivalently:
```bash
./soloptxmr.py \
-d 5 \
-a 75.2 \
-s "2022-02-20 20:22"
```

Setting the battery's voltage, rather than the Ah charge is a feature planned for the near future. For now, you have to resort to online resources in order to estimate the initial battery's state. [Example 1](http://www.scubaengineer.com/documents/lead_acid_battery_charging_graphs.pdf)

## Configuration
After running the `./util/config.sh` script, you'll be presented with paths to configuration scripts, that have just been copied to your `~/.config` directory. 
You're meant to adjust them to match your specifics.

### Arrays
Inside the `~/.config/solar/arrays.json` it's important to understand, that an array's parameter `surface_tilt` accepts degrees and 0 means laying flat horizontally on a roof, while 90 means hanging flat vertically on a wall. 
`surface_azimuth` uses 0 as north, 90 as east, 180 as south and 270 as west.

### Geo
Inside the `~/.config/solar/geo.json`, which is expected to be modified by you, according to the physical location of the solar farm, the northern hemisphere and eastern side of globe are represented with positive numbers of Lat / Lon in degrees. 
Southern hemisphere and western side of globe use negative numbers of Lat / Lon.

The variable `city` is meant to deliver weather reports.
It is possible, that your farm's location is so remote, that the city where it belongs to, isn't listed on the weather reports.
In such cases, please enter the nearest largest city, until the script stops complaining.

### Computers
Currently the system doesn't work very well with the number of mining machines larger than 2.
In case a single computer should be disabled, please set its `count` field to `0`.

### Habits
The `~/.config/solar/habits.json` config file allows you to declare your daily/weekly habits, that drain the solar power in a predictable way. 
The syntax used there for scheduling is better explained by [this documentation](https://github.com/mariusbancila/croncpp#cron-expressions).
A single example:

`0 15 10 * * ? *`	means: 10:15 AM every day

[Here's more interactive way](https://crontab.guru/) to understand the syntax. 
Note, that it doesn't use the required seconds part though.

As with the computers json, a given habit may be disabled by setting its `count` field to `0`.

### System
The `~/.config/solar/system.json` config file defines the voltage of the system (12 or 24 V) used for conversions.
Other 3 options include the ability to independently: generate, buy and/or sell the electricity. 
The combination of these options helps in deriving the optimal solution for your case, regarding the profitability of the operation.

### Electricity price
TODO: enable scheduling the electricity buy/sell prices via cron, like in the Habits json.

# Extra scripts

## Modeling solar arrays
The script `src/arrays.py` will help you understand how a mixture of various orientations of arrays, defined via `~/.config/solar/arrays.json` reduce the peak & through problem. 
By properly diversifying the orientation, you'll be blessed with more stable input across the day. 
Depending on your location, this might increase your profits of the electricity that you can't use domestically nor on mining, since the buyback prices might be a function of the time of day.

## First production model
A model with an integrated n-day weather prediction & multiple, user-defined mining rigs (here: 2).

## First model
A plot of the energetic balance, based on real astronomic data and contrived weather distortions, simulating the battery drainage with a horizon of 3 days:

## Network difficulty
These data are taken into account when making decision about starting a rig or not. 
Sometimes it's worth to wait for a while until other miners switch off their rigs in order to scoop more coins for the same amount of used power. 
Obviously this assumes, that your stored electricity doesn't go to waste. 
Also, please note the differences in scales of the two plots. 
The daily seasonal swings are 100 times smaller than the mean reversion ones.

## Solar array modeling
An example evaluation of 2 sets of panels - one set pointing to south-east and the other to south-west. 
Please note the prolonged production, reflected by the inverter's output.



## Console interactive UI
Accessible via `ssh`/`putty`, based on `curses`.
