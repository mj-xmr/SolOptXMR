# SolOptXMR
Solar Optimal mining of XMR.

The goal is to create open-source software that aids people mining Monero with excess solar power (as well as other supplementing renewables) in the most profitable way. 
It will accommodate for issues such as:

- Time of day
- Weather fluctuations
- Avoiding depleting batteries below a threshold, that would damage them
- Avoiding overheating of the mining rig
- Leaving enough power for your daily use

# Quickstart
In case these instructions become outdated, please refer to the steps of the [CI](.github/workflows/linux.yml).

## Preparation
Please run the below scripts. They are meant to be non-interactive and will require root permissions (via `sudo`). 
When in doubt, please view their contents with `cat` for an objective assessment of their functionalities.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mj-xmr/SolOptXMR.git # Clone this repo (assuming it's not a fork)
cd SolOptXMR		# Enter the cloned repo's dir
./util/prep-env.sh	# Prepare the environment - downloads example data and creates useful symlinks
./util/deps-pull.sh	# Download the maintaned dependencies
./util/deps-build.sh	# Build and install the unmanaged dependencies (uses sudo for installation)
```

## Building & running
```bash
./ci-default 					# Build and run the tests
./soloptxmr.py 				# Run the prediction with default parameters  
./soloptxmr.py --help # Print all the available options 
```

# Screenshots

## First model
A plot of the energetic balance, based on real astronomic data and contrived weather distortions, simulating the battery drainage with a horizon of 3 days:

## Console interactive UI
Accessible via `ssh`/`putty`, based on `curses`.

## Profitability calculation

```
Algo name:  Endor
Undervolted initial =  0.64%
Undervolted =  4.32%
Overvolted  =  25.99%
Total hashes = 175.83 MH
Total income = 34.64 USD
Total cost = 6.29 USD
Total profit = 28.35 USD
Profitability = 450.72 %
